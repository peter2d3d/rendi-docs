# Webhooks

Rendi provides webhooks to notify you when FFmpeg command processing is completed, whether successful or failed. This eliminates the need for continuous polling and allows your application to react to processing events asynchronously.

## Setting Up Webhooks

In rendi's dashboard, under the "Configuration" tab, you can set your webhook URL. The tab also allows you to test your webhook URL.

## Webhook Payload

When the command processing is complete, Rendi will send a POST request to your webhook URL.
The payload will have a data field which will be identical to what you would receive from the polling endpoint - containing the complete status of the command execution,
and a timestamp of when the webhook was sent - unix epoch time in milliseconds.

### Example Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "data": {
    "command_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "output_files": {
      "out_1": {
        "file_id": "e9cf7551-4c7d-405f-9090-76e74fa90ab9",
        "size_mbytes": 1.0111198425292969,
        "file_type": "image",
        "file_format": "gif",
        "storage_url": "https://storage.rendi.dev/temp_files/583b2877-15b7-48e3-8255-615991a945de/be603edd-5526-477c-98b1-fbf5f98a5a7b/output1.gif",
        "width": 284,
        "height": 160
      }
    },
    "original_request": {
      "input_files": {
        "in_1": "https://storage.rendi.dev/sample/sample.avi"
      },
      "output_files": {
        "out_1": "output1.gif"
      },
      "ffmpeg_command": "-i {{in_1}} -ss 00:00 -to 01:00 -vf select='lte(n\\,1)+gt(trunc(t/10),trunc(prev_t/10))',setpts='PTS*0.025',scale=trunc(oh*a/2)*2:160:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=trunc(oh*a/2)*2:160:-1:-1 -an -vsync vfr {{out_1}}"
    },
    "ffmpeg_command_run_seconds": 5.606014728546143,
    "total_processing_seconds": 8.821761
  },
  "timestamp": 1739130741156
}
```

For failed commands, the payload will include error details:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "error_status": "UNREACHABLE_INPUT_FILE",
    "error_message": "Failed to download file https://storage.rendi.dev/sample/sample_fail.avi, server returned status code 404",
    "status": "FAILED",
    "original_request": {
      "input_files": {
        "in_1": "https://storage.rendi.dev/sample/sample_fail.avi"
      },
      "output_files": {
        "out_1": "output1.gif"
      },
      "ffmpeg_command": "-i {{in_1}} -ss 00:00 -to 01:00 -vf select='lte(n\\,1)+gt(trunc(t/10),trunc(prev_t/10))',setpts='PTS*0.025',scale=trunc(oh*a/2)*2:160:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=trunc(oh*a/2)*2:160:-1:-1 -an -vsync vfr {{out_1}}"
    },
    "total_processing_seconds": 3.702893
  },
  "timestamp": 1739130741156
}
```

## Webhook Retry Policy

Each message is attempted based on the following schedule, where each period is started following the failure of the preceding attempt:

* Immediately
* 5 seconds
* 5 minutes
* 30 minutes
* 2 hours
* 5 hours
* 10 hours
* 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

After all retry attempts are exhausted, the webhook delivery will be marked as failed, and you will need to use the polling endpoint to retrieve the command status.

## Webhook Timeout

Your webhook endpoint should respond within 15 seconds. If it takes longer, Rendi will consider the delivery attempt failed and will retry according to the retry policy.

## Disabling failing endpoints

If all attempts to a specific endpoint fail for a period of 5 days, the endpoint will be disabled.
